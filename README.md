This is a collection of various brain teasers, interview questions, programming exercises, and fun problems.

The goal here is simply to practice problem solving. I hope to also use this as an area to experiment with new languages and/or technologies, as well as have some public code to prove I can indeed program some stuff.

I will be very appreciative of constructive criticism, as this is a learning exercise above all else.

Finally, some of these problems are/will be taken from the project euler problem set. If you are doing these please avoid that directory. Any problem from there that I solve has probably been solved and published elsewhere. The fun of problem solving is obviously ruined by cheating, so don't do it.
